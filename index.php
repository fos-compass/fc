<h2>The Free and Open Source Culture Quiz</h2>

<p>Our culture comprises in part the ever growing collection of stories, songs,
films, software, and the stuff of human creativity. Participation in our culture
entails any of consumption, production, sharing, changing, and contributing to a
work. Yet history has witnessed the rise and fall of many regimes dictating the
specifics of cultural participation. Companies of the recent era latch on to
characters and music through copyright. Software corporations hold tight their
ideas through patents.</p> 

<p>Other forms of creation do exist. Free and open source software development
has spun up with the internet. With it has arisen the Creative Commons and free
culture.</p>

<p>It is difficult to simply capture the cultural ideology of people today.  New
technologies have introduced new areas for disagreement and cooperation.  For
example, the average citizen may not be able to distinguish the views of Richard
Stallman or Linus Torvalds. While they may generally be grouped in a "freer"
category, their views do differ.</p>

<p>Our work follows that ideological orientation should expand beyond a binary
system of good and bad. There are many pervasive issues in the area of free and
open source culture, so it is good to separate them. Our short quiz will present
you with a number of propositions. You must determine your agreement with each;
possible values are Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree. It
is important that you make a choice in either direction.  You cannot remain
neutral.</p>

<p>The questions will probe your views in a number of areas with the goal of
presenting your ideology on two axes. It is best to take the quiz before
learning the specific methodology behind the quiz questions. <b>At no time is
your data logged. The data is used to calculate your result which will remain
private for your use</b>.</p>

<p><a href="index.php">Are you ready to take the quiz?</a></p>

<p>Once you're done, you can check out how notable people in the software and
content industry might answer the same questions. These results were determined
by our study of the chosen industry leaders and any of their published works.
The answers do not officially represent their views or opinions.</p>
