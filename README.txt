Setting up the site:
1) Place the site files somewhere beneath the Web root of an HTTP server supporting PHP5.
2) Download the free (GPL) pChart library from http://pchart.net/download
3) Extract the pChart archive into the same folder as the site artifacts, not into a PChart-*/ subfolder
4) Create a directory called img/ at the same level as the site and pChart stuff and grant the Web server write and execute.
