<h2>The Free and Open Source Culture Quiz</h2>

<p>Our culture comprises in part the ever growing collection of stories, songs,
films, software, and the stuff of human creativity. Participation in our culture
entails consumption, production, sharing, or changing of any such
work. Yet history has witnessed the rise and fall of many regimes dictating the
specifics of cultural participation. Contemporary companies latch on to
characters and music through copyright and patents.</p>

<p>Not all creators seek to gain exclusive rights to their work, however. For example, developers have founded and contributed to numerous free and open source software projects
over the Internet. Similarly, creators in other domains have furthered free culture by establishing the Creative Commons.</p>

<p>It is difficult to simply capture the cultural ideology of people today because new
technologies have introduced new areas for disagreement and cooperation.  How can we compare the views of people such as Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds, who agree on some issues but have drastically different takes on others. For example, both are advocates for free software, but have become divided over the issue of digital rights management.</p>

<p>Our work stresses that one's ideological orientation is more than just a
binary quality of open and closed. There are many pervasive issues in the area
of free and open source culture, so it is useful to establish a benchmark that
breaks down one's views. Our short quiz will present you with a number of
propositions. You must determine your agreement with each; possible values are
Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree. It is important that you
make a choice in either direction.  You cannot remain neutral.</p>

<p>The questions will probe your views in a number of areas with the goal of
presenting your ideology on two axes. It is best to take the quiz before
learning the specific methodology behind the quiz questions. <b>At no time is
your data logged. The data is used to calculate your result which will remain
